Agriculture contributes a significant share of global greenhouse-gas emissions, much of which comes from upstream inputs, on-farm activities, and downstream supply-chain operations. 
In this case, an agricultural equipment and solutions manufacturer partnered with McKinsey & Company to accelerate decarbonization across the farming supply chain while maintaining productivity and farmer economics.

The company faced a complex challenge. Emissions were spread across equipment manufacturing, fertilizer usage, fuel consumption, and farming practices. 
Farmers needed solutions that reduced emissions without increasing costs or disrupting yields. 
At the same time, regulators and customers were demanding measurable sustainability outcomes.

McKinsey supported the organization in building a full emissions baseline across the value chain. 
This included Scope 1, Scope 2, and key Scope 3 sources. Advanced analytics were used to identify the highest-impact levers, such as fuel efficiency, precision agriculture, low-carbon inputs, and digital farm management tools.

The team designed a decarbonization roadmap focused on scalable interventions. 
These included precision farming technologies to reduce fertilizer use, equipment optimization to lower fuel consumption, digital tools to improve field efficiency, and supplier engagement to reduce upstream emissions. 
Farmers were offered practical solutions supported by incentives, training, and data-driven insights.

Pilot programs showed strong results. Participating farms reduced input waste, improved fuel efficiency, and lowered emissions while maintaining or improving yields. 
Digital monitoring enabled transparent measurement of emissions reductions and cost impacts, helping farmers make informed decisions.

The initiative demonstrated that decarbonization in agriculture is achievable when technology, data, and farmer economics are aligned. 
By combining analytics, digital tools, and ecosystem collaboration, the company created a practical pathway to scale sustainable farming practices across regions.
